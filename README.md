# KNN Classifier

It will train and test each time you run the code

knn_image_classifier.py - This code processes the images by masking the surrounding around the signs and resizes them to 32x32 pixels.
The KNN classifier gets trained on the processed images and achieves the accuracy of 99% on the test data.

There are two ways to run this code:

1) With visualization of fed images:
python knn_image_classifier.py

2) Without visualization of fed images:
python -O knn_image_classifier.py

NOTE: here the -O is the capital letter not zero. For details, read the final.pdf.
